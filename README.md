# E-Invoicing API for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)

This project developed a SaaS API to generate e-invoices in UBL 2.1 format. The API supports CSV, JSON, and GUI input formats and integrates with an invoice validator to ensure compliance.  The focus was on providing a solution tailored for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by concentrating on core invoice generation functionality and essential fields.

## Key Features

* **Versatile Input:** Supports CSV, JSON, and GUI input formats for generating e-invoices.
* **UBL 2.1 Compliance:** Generates invoices in the required UBL 2.1 format.
* **Automated Validation:** Integrates with an invoice validator to ensure compliance and reduce errors.
* **Targeted for SMEs:** Focuses on core invoice functionality and essential fields, simplifying the process for smaller businesses.

## Business Value

This API automates and standardizes invoice conversion, replacing the manual, time-consuming, inefficient, and error-prone process of converting various types of invoices into Australian standard XML format.  By automating and standardizing invoice conversion, this product improves the quality of users' jobs by saving time and enhancing accuracy.

## Technical Approach

The project prioritized effective teamwork and task allocation, ensuring workload was distributed evenly and team members worked in their areas of expertise. Progress was tracked and communicated regularly.  The API utilizes a PostgreSQL database for data persistence, is built using the Flask framework, and is deployed on AWS Lightsail.

**Note:** The current deployment of this project is under maintenance.

## Project Management and Reflection

The team employed agile methodologies, conducting sprint retrospectives after each sprint to reflect on progress and identify areas for improvement.  Regular meetings included discussions of challenges, and feedback was actively solicited and incorporated from mentor meetings.  This iterative approach allowed the team to adapt and refine their process throughout the project.
